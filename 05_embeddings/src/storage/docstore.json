It\u2019s a commitment that we\u2019ve all made no matter what. If the war is going on, then we\u2019re all in war. We\u2019re at war with Russia, if that were the case.\u201d\n\nBiden said that he\u2019s spoken to Zelensky at length about the issue, saying that he\u2019s told the Ukrainian president the US would keep providing security and weaponry for Ukraine like it does for Israel while the process plays out.\n\n\u201cI think we have to lay out a rational path for Ukraine to be able to qualify to be able to get into NATO,\u201d Biden said, noting that he refused Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s demands before the war for a commitment not to admit Ukraine because the alliance has \u201can open-door policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think it\u2019s premature to say, to call for a vote, you know, in now, because there\u2019s other qualifications that need to be met, including democratization and some of those issues,\u201d Biden said.\n\nOn Friday, the White House announced that the US was sending Ukraine cluster munitions for the first time, a step taken to help bolster Ukraine\u2019s ammunition as it mounts a counteroffensive against Russia. Biden told Zakaria that it was a \u201cdifficult decision\u201d to give Ukraine the controversial ammunition, but that he was convinced it was necessary because Ukraine was running out of ammunition.\n\nThe NATO meeting also comes as Sweden is seeking to join the Western alliance, a move that has faced resistance from Turkey and Hungary. Biden told Zakaria he was optimistic that Sweden would eventually be admitted to NATO, noting the key holdout, Turkey, is seeking to modernize its F-16 fleet, along with Greece, which has voted to admit Sweden.\n\n\u201cTurkey is looking for modernization of F-16 aircraft. And (Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos) Mitsotakis in Greece is also looking for some help,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd so, what I\u2019m trying to, quite frankly, put together is a little bit of a consortium here, where we\u2019re strengthening NATO in terms of military capacity of both Greece as well as Turkey, and allow Sweden to come in. But it\u2019s in play. It\u2019s not done.\u201d\n\nIn the wide-ranging interview, Biden and Zakaria also discussed other key foreign policy challenges, including China, Saudi Arabia and Israel.\n\nBiden said that he\u2019s confident Chinese President Xi Jinping wants to replace the US as the country with the largest economy and military capacity in the world, but he said that he believes the US can have a working relationship with Beijing.\n\n\u201cI think there is a way to resolve, to establish a working relationship with China that benefits them and", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3708, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "d4f6a69c-47a9-41c9-80fc-0e08d8ebbcfc": {"__data__": {"id_": "d4f6a69c-47a9-41c9-80fc-0e08d8ebbcfc", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "93595b89-add4-4332-a150-84dbb6b9aea3", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "c10fc693bfc898950168e34be4bc321fa9dcbaacc9df45f8df1b4bd72f027e1d"}, "2": {"node_id": "e3743770-1062-403c-b417-e7cca4f1955b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "9f9e0299c9c2479dc9d0892065d3560beee6c85c0f220c63ae01bb76969c6031"}}, "hash": "c9e431698e8f64e83f17e4a7aa7046382ecbc8e93a68393d2795bf04124543e5", "text": "is a way to resolve, to establish a working relationship with China that benefits them and us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd the last thing I\u2019ll tell you, I also called him after he had that meeting with the Russians about this new relationship, etc. And I said, \u2018This is not a threat.

They have no right to be here, etc.,\u2019\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd I think we were talking with them regularly, trying to tamp down what\u2019s going on and hopefully, Bibi will continue to move toward moderation and change.\u201d\n\nBiden also defended his trip to Saudi Arabia last year, telling Zakaria a number of successes came from the visit, such as establishing Israeli overflights over Saudi Arabia. Asked whether the US would provide the Saudis with a defense treaty and civilian nuclear capacity, as Riyadh has requested, Biden said, \u201cWe\u2019re a long way from there.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether or not we would provide a means by which they can have civilian nuclear power, and/or be a guarantor of their security \u2013 I think that\u2019s a little way off,\u201d Biden said.", "start_char_idx": 3618, "end_char_idx": 6104, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "9aa20360-cee1-4f98-9e2d-9b615f7d54a6": {"__data__": {"id_": "9aa20360-cee1-4f98-9e2d-9b615f7d54a6", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62ce754b-c8e5-4aea-ba38-27bd5d41ae80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d9851cd6354f8d6e0139fe32bb56bc733ccbc52f21adfe5ffb4b276f7f21b3c"}, "3": {"node_id": "0dc4760f-a7f4-4b71-9bcd-dbb9374e864b", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "103b49861da957350f505f443bfe338af8cad615a9bf14ec5763eda911baa20c"}}, "hash": "7f0a34953a9ba661aec86dbd61c2c5713c67416196b1adfdebfabea90b2119fe", "text": "Mark Zuckerberg concealed his kids\u2019 faces on Instagram. Should you?\n\nBy Samantha Murphy Kelly, CNN\nPublished 5:04 AM EDT, Sun July 9, 2023\n\n\nWhen Mark Zuckerberg shared a photo on Instagram of his family on July 4, two things stuck out: the billionaire CEO wore a striped souvenir cowboy hat, and the faces of his children were replaced with happy face emojis.\n\nZuckerberg\u2019s post was promptly criticized by some who saw the decision to obscure the faces as a reflection of his privacy concerns for sharing pictures of his children online, despite his creating massive platforms that allow millions of other parents to do just that.\n\nMeta, Instagram\u2019s parent company, has long been scrutinized over how it handles user privacy and for the way its algorithms can be used to lead young users down potentially harmful rabbit hoes.\n\nBut the choice also highlights a broader trend among some social media users, and particularly among high-profile individuals, to be more cautious in sharing identifiable pictures of their children online.\n\nFor years, celebrities from Kristen Bell and Gigi Hadid to Chris Pratt and Orlando Bloom have been blurring images or using emojis to help protect their kids\u2019 privacy on social media. Zuckerberg, too, had previously posted pictures of the back of his daughters\u2019 heads and their side profiles rather than showing their entire faces.\n\nIt\u2019s more rare for everyday users to take a similar approach \u2014 but perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be.\n\n\u201cBy modeling for us that he was careful not to share his family\u2019s location or childrens\u2019 identities, he may be communicating that it is the end users\u2019 responsibility to protect themselves online,\u201d said Alexandra Hamlet, a New York City-based psychologist who closely follows the impact of social media on young users.\n\nMeta did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFew things are as central to the parenting experience as showing numerous, possibly embarrassing, pictures of your children with anyone who will stop and look. But over the years, a growing number of parents and experts have raised concerns about the risks of sharing these pictures on social media, including the possibility of exposing kids to identify theft and facial recognition technology, as well as creating an internet history that could follow them into adulthood.\n\nSome parents choose to either restrict how much they share about their kids or limit sharing to less public platforms. Others adopt more clever hacks like obscuring their children\u2019s faces.\n\nLeah Plunkett, author of \u201cSharenthood\u201d and associate dean of learning experience and innovation (LXI) at Harvard Law School, said blocking a child\u2019s face is a symbol that you\u2019re giving them control over their own narrative.\n\n\u201cEvery time you post about your kids, you are chipping away at allowing them to tell their own stories about who they are and who they want to become,\u201d she said. \u201cWe grow up making mischief and more than a few mistakes and grow up better having made them. If we lose the privacy of teens and kids to play and explore, and to live and through trial and error, we will deprive them of the ability to develop and tell stories [on their own terms].\u201d\n\nNoticeably, Zuckerberg did not obscure the face of his infant daughter, which might suggest less concern with the risks for a baby\u2019s face than a young child. However, Plunkett said artificial intelligence technology can be used to trace a face\u2019s changes over time and may still be able to later connect any child, even a baby, to an image of them when older.\n\nPlunkett believes social media companies can do more, such as offering a setting that automatically blurs kids\u2019 faces or prevents any picture with a child from being used for marketing or advertising purposes.\n\nFor now, however, the onus remains on parents to limit or abstain sharing photos of their kids online.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just parents \u2013 grandparents, coaches, teachers and other trusted adults should also keep kids out of photos and videos to protect their privacy, safety, future and current", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4022, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "0dc4760f-a7f4-4b71-9bcd-dbb9374e864b": {"__data__": {"id_": "0dc4760f-a7f4-4b71-9bcd-dbb9374e864b", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "62ce754b-c8e5-4aea-ba38-27bd5d41ae80", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "3d9851cd6354f8d6e0139fe32bb56bc733ccbc52f21adfe5ffb4b276f7f21b3c"}, "2": {"node_id": "9aa20360-cee1-4f98-9e2d-9b615f7d54a6", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "7f0a34953a9ba661aec86dbd61c2c5713c67416196b1adfdebfabea90b2119fe"}}, "hash": "103b49861da957350f505f443bfe338af8cad615a9bf14ec5763eda911baa20c", "text": "should also keep kids out of photos and videos to protect their privacy, safety, future and current opportunities, and their ability to figure out their own story about themselves and for themselves,\u201d she said.", "start_char_idx": 3923, "end_char_idx": 4133, "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_seperator": "\n"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a691ca7c-cf11-4639-b489-3c688770c6d0": {"__data__": {"id_": "a691ca7c-cf11-4639-b489-3c688770c6d0", "embedding": null, "metadata": {}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": [], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": [], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "7e78bdb2-379b-4260-8e15-d69c7693d3fb", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "e0f4576e3974b24c13732b7fc8a33c449502193c9c71cc34e42cdbbfe07a1995"}, "3": {"node_id": "d5e05965-b10f-4c02-993c-cc3b0d38ca21", "node_type": null, "metadata": {}, "hash": "0e497455c27a6f31b0b08fb7ca92702488ad0526818ec919011ea38f7bcbece5"}}, "hash": "d1002ef2426b77efd577dcff80d0c1fa1c408639b928457524aa0750ff683065", "text": "Yellen sees 'progress' in rocky US-China ties, expects more communication\n\nBy Andrea Shalal\nJuly 9, 20236:37 AM PDTUpdated 7 hours ago\n\nBEIJING, July 9 (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said 10 hours of meetings with senior Chinese officials in recent days were \"direct\" and \"productive\", helping stabilise the superpowers' often rocky relationship as her four-day Beijing trip ended.\n\nBefore departing China on Sunday, Yellen said the United States and China remained at odds on a number of issues but expressed confidence that her visit had advanced efforts to put the relationship on \"surer footing\".\n\n\"The U.S. and China have significant disagreements,\" Yellen told a press conference at the U.S. embassy in Beijing, citing Washington's concerns about what she called \"unfair economic practices\" and recent punitive actions against U.S. firms.\n\n\"But President (Joe) Biden and I do not see the relationship between the U.S. and China through the frame of great power conflict.
